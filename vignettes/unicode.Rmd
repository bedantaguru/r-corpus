Unicode: Emoji, accents, and other international text
=====================================================



Character encoding
------------------

Before we can analyze a text in R, we first need to get its digital
representation, a sequence of ones and zeros. In practice this works by first
choosing an *encoding* for the text that assigns each character a numerical
value, and then translating the sequence of characters in the text to the
corresponding sequence of numbers specified by the encoding. Today, most new
text is encoded according to the [Unicode standard][unicode], specifically the
8-bit block Unicode Transfer Format, [UTF-8][utf8].  Joel Spolsky gives a
good overview of the situation in an [essay from 2003][spolsky2003].


The software community has mostly moved to UTF-8 as a standard for text
storage and interchange, but there is still a large volume of text in other
encodings. Whenever you read a text file into R, you need to specify the
encoding. If you don't, R will try to guess the encoding, and if it guesses
incorrectly, it will wrongly interpret the sequence of ones and zeros.


We will demonstrate the difficulties with encodings with the text of
Jane Austen's novel, _Mansfield Park_ provided by
[Project Gutenberg][gutenberg]. We will download the text, then
read in the lines of the novel using the *readr* package.


```r
tmp <- tempfile()
url <- "http://www.gutenberg.org/files/141/141.txt"
download.file(url, tmp)
lines <- readr::read_lines(tmp)
```

The `read_lines` function has a `locale` argument which, if left unspecified
as here, defaults to assuming that text is encoded as "UTF-8". Really, we
should specify the encoding ourselves. Unfortunately, the file
extension ".txt" does not tell us the encoding. However, if we read the first
few lines of the file, we see the following:


```r
lines[11:20]
```

```
 [1] "Author: Jane Austen"                                         
 [2] ""                                                            
 [3] "Release Date: June, 1994  [Etext #141]"                      
 [4] "Posting Date: February 11, 2015"                             
 [5] ""                                                            
 [6] "Language: English"                                           
 [7] ""                                                            
 [8] "Character set encoding: ASCII"                               
 [9] ""                                                            
[10] "*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MANSFIELD PARK ***"
```

The file claims to be ASCII, and we read in the text assuming that it was
encoded as UTF-8. So, we should be in good shape. However, we run into trouble
as soon as we try to process the text:


```r
term_counts(lines) # produces an error
```

```
Error in knitr::knit("src/unicode.Rmd"): argument entry 15252 is marked as "UTF-8" but contains an invalid byte in position 36 (\xa3)
```

The error message tells us that line 15252 contains an invalid byte.


```r
lines[15252]
```

```
[1] "the command of her beauty, and her \xa320,000, any one who could satisfy the"
```

We might wonder if there are other lines with invalid data.  We can find
all such lines using the `utf8_valid` function:

```r
lines[!utf8_valid(lines)]
```

```
[1] "the command of her beauty, and her \xa320,000, any one who could satisfy the"
```
The `\xa3` is a code for a byte with the hexadecimal value `0xA3`, decimal
value 163. To understand why this is invalid, we need to learn more about
UTF-8 encoding.


UTF-8
-----

### ASCII

The smallest unit of data transfer on modern computers is the byte, a sequence
of eight ones and zeros that can encode a number between 0 and 255
(hexadecimal 0x00 and 0xff). In the earliest character encodings, the numbers
from 0 to 127 (hexadecimal 0x00 to 0x7f) were standardized in an encoding
known as ASCII, the American Standard Code for Information Interchange.
Here are the characters corresponding to these codes:


```r
codes <- matrix(0:127, 8, 16, byrow = TRUE,
                dimnames = list(0:7, c(0:9, letters[1:6])))
ascii <- apply(codes, c(1, 2), intToUtf8)

utf8_print(ascii, quote = FALSE)
```

```
  0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9      a      b      c      d      e      f     
0        \u0001 \u0002 \u0003 \u0004 \u0005 \u0006 \a     \b     \t     \n     \v     \f     \r     \u000e \u000f
1 \u0010 \u0011 \u0012 \u0013 \u0014 \u0015 \u0016 \u0017 \u0018 \u0019 \u001a \u001b \u001c \u001d \u001e \u001f
2        !      "      #      $      %      &      '      (      )      *      +      ,      -      .      /     
3 0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9      :      ;      <      =      >      ?     
4 @      A      B      C      D      E      F      G      H      I      J      K      L      M      N      O     
5 P      Q      R      S      T      U      V      W      X      Y      Z      [      \      ]      ^      _     
6 `      a      b      c      d      e      f      g      h      i      j      k      l      m      n      o     
7 p      q      r      s      t      u      v      w      x      y      z      {      |      }      ~      \u007f
```
The first 32 codes (the first two rows of the table) are special control
codes, the most common of which, `0x0a` denotes a new line (`\n`). The special
code `0x00` often denotes the end of the input, and R does not allow this
value in character strings. When `utf8_print` the low level `utf8_encode`
subroutine format control codes, they do so as `\uXXXX` for four hexadecimal
digits `XXXX` or as `\UXXXXYYYY` for eight hexadecimal digits `XXXXYYYY`.

Compare the output with the base R print function:

```r
print(ascii, quote = FALSE)
```

```
  0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    a    b    c    d    e    f   
0      \001 \002 \003 \004 \005 \006 \a   \b   \t   \n   \v   \f   \r   \016 \017

2      !    "    #    $    %    &    '    (    )    *    +    ,    -    .    /   
3 0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    :    ;    <    =    >    ?   
4 @    A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I    J    K    L    M    N    O   
5 P    Q    R    S    T    U    V    W    X    Y    Z    [    \\   ]    ^    _   
6 `    a    b    c    d    e    f    g    h    i    j    k    l    m    n    o   
7 p    q    r    s    t    u    v    w    x    y    z    {    |    }    ~    \177
```
Base R format control codes below 128 using octal escapes. There are some
other differences between the function which we will highlight below.


### Latin-1

ASCII works fine for most text in English, but not for other languages. The
Latin-1 encoding extends ASCII to Latin languages by assigning the numbers
128 to 255 (hexadecimal 0x80 to 0xff) to other common characters in Latin
languages. We can see these characters below.


```r
codes <- matrix(128:255, 8, 16, byrow = TRUE,
                dimnames = list(c(8:9, letters[1:6]), c(0:9, letters[1:6])))
latin1 <- apply(codes, c(1, 2), intToUtf8)

utf8_print(latin1, quote = FALSE)
```

```
  0      1      2      3      4      5      6      7      8      9      a      b      c      d      e      f     
8 \u0080 \u0081 \u0082 \u0083 \u0084 \u0085 \u0086 \u0087 \u0088 \u0089 \u008a \u008b \u008c \u008d \u008e \u008f
9 \u0090 \u0091 \u0092 \u0093 \u0094 \u0095 \u0096 \u0097 \u0098 \u0099 \u009a \u009b \u009c \u009d \u009e \u009f
a        ¡      ¢      £      ¤      ¥      ¦      §      ¨      ©      ª      «      ¬             ®      ¯     
b °      ±      ²      ³      ´      µ      ¶      ·      ¸      ¹      º      »      ¼      ½      ¾      ¿     
c À      Á      Â      Ã      Ä      Å      Æ      Ç      È      É      Ê      Ë      Ì      Í      Î      Ï     
d Ð      Ñ      Ò      Ó      Ô      Õ      Ö      ×      Ø      Ù      Ú      Û      Ü      Ý      Þ      ß     
e à      á      â      ã      ä      å      æ      ç      è      é      ê      ë      ì      í      î      ï     
f ð      ñ      ò      ó      ô      õ      ö      ÷      ø      ù      ú      û      ü      ý      þ      ÿ     
```

As with ASCII, the first 32 numbers are control codes. The others are
characters common in Latin languages. Note that `0xa3`, the invalid byte
from _Mansfield Park_, corresponds to a pound sign in the Latin-1 encoding.
Given the context of the byte:
```
lines[15252]
```
this is probably the right symbol. The text is probably encoded in Latin-1,
not UTF-8 or ASCII as claimed in the file.

If you run into an error while reading text that claims to be ASCII, it
is probably encoded as Latin-1. Note, however, that this is not the only
possibility, and there are many other encodings. The `iconvlist` function
will list the ones that R knows how to process:


```r
head(iconvlist(), n = 20)
```

```
 [1] "437"            "850"            "852"            "855"            "857"            "860"           
 [7] "861"            "862"            "863"            "865"            "866"            "869"           
[13] "ANSI_X3.4-1968" "ANSI_X3.4-1986" "ARABIC"         "ARMSCII-8"      "ASCII"          "ASMO-708"      
[19] "ATARI"          "ATARIST"       
```

### UTF-8

With only 256 unique values, a single byte is not enough to encode every
character. Multi-byte encodings allow for encoding more. UTF-8 encodes
characters using between 1 and 4 bytes each and allows for up to 1,112,064
character codes. Most of these codes are currently unassigned, but every year
the Unicode consortium meets and adds new characters. You can find a list of
all of the characters in the [Unicode Character Database][unicode-data]. A
listing of the Emoji characters is [available separately][emoji-data].


Say you want to input the Unicode character with hexadecimal code 0x2603.
You can do so in one of three ways:

```r
"\u2603"           # with \u + 4 hex digits
```

```
[1] "☃"
```

```r
"\U00002603"       # with \U + 8 hex digits
```

```
[1] "☃"
```

```r
intToUtf8(0x2603)  # from an integer
```

```
[1] "☃"
```
For characters above `0xffff`, the first method won't work. On Windows,
a bug in the current version of R (fixed in R-devel) prevents using the
second method.


When you try to print Unicode in R, the system will first try to determine
whether the code is printable or not. Non-printable codes include control
codes and unassigned codes. On Mac OS, R uses an outdated function to make
this determination, so it is unable to print most emoji. The `utf8_print`
function uses the most recent version (10.0.0) of the Unicode standard,
and will print all Unicode characters supported by your system:


```r
print(intToUtf8(0x1f600 + 0:79)) # base R
```

```
[1] "\U0001f600\U0001f601\U0001f602\U0001f603\U0001f604\U0001f605\U0001f606\U0001f607\U0001f608\U0001f609\U0001f60a\U0001f60b\U0001f60c\U0001f60d\U0001f60e\U0001f60f\U0001f610\U0001f611\U0001f612\U0001f613\U0001f614\U0001f615\U0001f616\U0001f617\U0001f618\U0001f619\U0001f61a\U0001f61b\U0001f61c\U0001f61d\U0001f61e\U0001f61f\U0001f620\U0001f621\U0001f622\U0001f623\U0001f624\U0001f625\U0001f626\U0001f627\U0001f628\U0001f629\U0001f62a\U0001f62b\U0001f62c\U0001f62d\U0001f62e\U0001f62f\U0001f630\U0001f631\U0001f632\U0001f633\U0001f634\U0001f635\U0001f636\U0001f637\U0001f638\U0001f639\U0001f63a\U0001f63b\U0001f63c\U0001f63d\U0001f63e\U0001f63f\U0001f640\U0001f641\U0001f642\U0001f643\U0001f644\U0001f645\U0001f646\U0001f647\U0001f648\U0001f649\U0001f64a\U0001f64b\U0001f64c\U0001f64d\U0001f64e\U0001f64f"
