To Do
=====

Features
--------

 * `[<-` for text

 * `[[<-` for text

 * `c()` for text.

 * `rep()` for text

 * `summary.text` could be better

 * `text_subset(,terms)`

 * Need calls to `R_CheckUserInterrupt()` in long-running computations
   (without leaking memory).

 * Passing a `token_filter` everywhere is annoying, error-prone. Allow
   setting a `filter` property on text objects to act as a default.

 * `as_corpus`
